# DB Power Supply

My version of the [FC Power Supply](https://frequencycentral.co.uk/product/fc-power/), which is also inspired by [Moritz Klein's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKN30Mzi2g).

Check out my [blog post](https://dbusteed.github.io/diy-eurorack-dual-power-supply/) for the following info: 
- Power specs
- Build price
- Pictures!

Schematics and stripboard layout are in this directory.
