# DB VCO

My version of a 3340 VCO, after combining different elements of [Sebastian Murgul's](https://sebastian-murgul.com/hardware/modular-synthesizer/as3340-vco/) and [LMNC's] (https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/cem-3340-diy-simple/) design.

Check out my [blog post](https://dbusteed.github.io/diy-eurorack-voltage-controlled-oscillator/) for the following info: 
- Power specs
- Build price
- Pictures!

Schematics and stripboard layout are in this directory.
