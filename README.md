# Project files for my DIY Eurorack adventure

Folders are organized by module, and usually include links to resources, schematics, stripboard layouts, etc.

## Note on Module / Design Names

I don't have the skills and knowledge to design my own modules from scratch, therefore these modules are heavily influenced (if not outright copied) from other creators. I always give credit to these sources.

However, I do occasionaly make slight changes to schematics as well as creating my own stripboard layouts. To avoid misleading anyone who might come across my version of these modules, I like to give the modules a new name (usually something boring like `db_vcf`). So just to be clear, I'm in no way claiming I'm the sole designer of a certian module, but I do add a custom name to distinguish it from the design of the original creators.

## Tools

I use [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) for schematics and [DIYLC](https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/) for stripboard layouts.
